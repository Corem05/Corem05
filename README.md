## Expertise in Languages

### Most used Languages:

Just before talk about my most used language I want to add that I am able to adapt and and work with almost any language due to my flexibility and eagerness to learn

- **Java**: I'm highly proficient in Java and feel very comfortable using it for all types of projects as well as competitive programming.
- **JS/TS**: Mainly, I have used these languages when I am creating web applications

Other languages:

- **C++**: I mainly used C++ for competitive programming
- **Python**: I have used this language for its libraries and ease of use in programming competitions



# Portfolio

I'm in the process of creating my own portfolio, made with Next.js, React and TypeScript which includes some additional information about myself and my projects. You can check it out here: **[portfolio URL](https://odiador.github.io/odiador)**
